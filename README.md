*TL;DR: Replace those rusty state machines with safe and scalable arbitration graphs!*

**Hierarchical behavior models for complex decision-making and behavior generation in robotics!**

- üå± **Bottom-up**  
  Combine simple atomic behavior components to generate complex behaviors.
- üß© **Functional decomposition**  
  Behavior components address *How to do it?* and *Can we do it?*, while Arbitrators decide *What to do?*
 - üß† **Meta-framework**  
  Integrate diverse methods in one decision-making framework. Why not combine optimization-based planning, probabilistic approaches (POMDPs), and machine learning (RL)? Use any approach where it performs best!
- üìà **Scalability**  
  Stack behavior components in arbitrators to create hierarchical behavior models.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Maintainability**  
  Add new behaviors without having to touch existing ones ‚Äì did we mention strict modularity and functional decomposition?
- üí° **Transparency**  
  Easily follow and understand the decision-making process.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Behavior Verification**  
  Use tightly integrated verifiers to ensure that only safe and valid behavior commands are executed.
- ü™Ç **Graceful Degradation**  
  Your behavior is unreliable or unsafe? Arbitrators will gracefully fall back to the next-best option.
- üì¶ **Header-Only**  
  Simple integration ‚Äì just include this header-only C++ library!
- üêç **Python Bindings**  
  For easy prototyping, testing, and integration of machine learning algorithms, all the functionality is available via Python bindings.
- üìú **Permissive License**  
  Published under MIT license to ensure maximum flexibility for your projects.


## Demo

We provide a demo of this library using Pac-Man as an example application.  
The arbitration graph controls Pac-Man on its journey to collect tasty dots üç¨

Run the demo with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KIT-MRT/arbitration_graphs.git
cd arbitration_graphs/demo
docker compose up
```

Open the GUI with your favorite browser:  
[http://0.0.0.0:8080](http://0.0.0.0:8080)

### Explanation

You will see the *Pacman Agent* arbitrator selecting between five behavior options (by priority).  
The *Eat Dots* option is itself an arbitrator with two sub-behaviors (selecting by expected benefit).

In this scene,
- the *Chase Ghost* and *Avoid Ghost* behaviors are not applicable (no ghosts in close vicinity) ‚Üí grey background,
- the *Eat Closest Dot* and *Move Randomly* behavior failed verification (our verification showcase) ‚Üí red background,
- thus, the least-prioritized *Stay in Place* behavior is being executed ‚Üí green background.

## Installation

The `arbitration_graphs` library consists of two parts
- **Core**  
  This is what it's all about ‚Äì base classes for arbitrators and behavior components, implementations of various arbitration schemes, behavior verification, ‚Ä¶
- **GUI** *optional*  
  Draws a live visual representation of the arbitration state (full graph, currently active behavior, current costs of behaviors, ‚Ä¶) in a WebApp GUI. Supports SVG export as the one above (great for publications).

<details>
<summary>Prerequisites</summary>

First make sure all dependencies are installed:
- [glog](https://github.com/google/glog)
- [util_caching](https://github.com/KIT-MRT/util_caching)
- [yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp)
- [Googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest) (optional, if you want to build unit tests)
- [Crow](https://crowcpp.org) (optional, needed for GUI only)
- [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (optional, if you want to build Python bindings and Python unit tests)

See also the [`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile) for how to install these packages under Debian or Ubuntu.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Installation using Debian package (recommended)</summary>

We provide a Debian package for easy installation on Debian-based distributions.
Download the latest `.deb` packages for the [core library](https://github.com/KIT-MRT/arbitration_graphs/releases/latest/download/libarbitration-graphs-core-dev.deb)
and optionally for [the gui](https://github.com/KIT-MRT/arbitration_graphs/releases/latest/download/libarbitration-graphs-gui-dev.deb) install them with `dpkg`:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i libarbitration-graphs-core-dev.deb
sudo dpkg -i libarbitration-graphs-gui-dev.deb
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Installation from .zip/.tar.gz</summary>

As this is a header-only library, no platform-specific compilation is needed.
So, you can also install the files directly from our release [`.zip` or `.tar.gz` archives](https://github.com/KIT-MRT/arbitration_graphs/releases/latest):

```bash
tar xf arbitration_graphs-core.tar.gz --directory=/
tar xf arbitration_graphs-gui.tar.gz --directory=/
```

This installs into `/usr/[include,lib,share]/arbitration_graphs`.
Please read [Serving the WebApp GUI](#serving-the-webapp-gui) below, if you consider custom installation paths and want to use the GUI.

</details> 

<details>
<summary>Using Docker image with pre-installed library</summary>

We provide a Docker image with the library and all dependencies already installed globally.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/kit-mrt/arbitration_graphs
```

The library is located under `/usr/local/include/arbitration_graphs/` and `/usr/local/lib/cmake/arbitration_graphs/`.
So, it can be easily loaded with CMake:

```cmake
find_package(arbitration_graphs REQUIRED)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Building from source using CMake</summary>

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KIT-MRT/arbitration_graphs.git
cd arbitration_graphs
```

Compile and install the project with CMake:

```bash
mkdir -p arbitration_graphs/build
cd arbitration_graphs/build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
sudo cmake --install .
```

In order to skip compiling the GUI, use `cmake -DBUILD_GUI=false ..` instead.

</details>

## Python Bindings

The library can be used in Python via pybind11 bindings.
Since `arbitration_graphs` is a templated C++ library,
  you need to explicitly instantiate the template for the types you want to use in Python.
For this, we provide convenience functions to bind the library for the desired types.
Simply call them in a pybind11 module definition, e.g.:

```cpp
PYBIND11_MODULE(arbitration_graphs, m) {
    python_api::bindArbitrationGraphs<MyCommand>(m);
}
```
and use them in Python.
For example, you could implement a custom behavior that inherits from the abstract `Behavior` class.

```python
from arbitration_graphs import Behavior

class MyBehavior(Behavior):
    def __init__(self, "my_behavior"):
        super().__init__(name)
```
We re-implemented all of the C++ unit tests in Python, so take a closer look at those for more advanced usage examples.


## Development

<details>
<summary>Using Docker image</summary>

Clone the repository and run the development image

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KIT-MRT/arbitration_graphs.git
cd arbitration_graphs
docker compose build
docker compose run --rm arbitration_graphs_devel
```

This mounts the source into the container's `/home/blinky/arbitration_graphs` folder.
There, you can edit the source code, compile and run the tests etc.

</details>


<details>
<summary>Compiling unit tests</summary>

To compile and run the C++ unit tests, make sure Googletest is available.
For the Python tests, make sure pybind11 is installed.

In order to compile with tests define `BUILD_TESTS=true`
```bash
mkdir -p arbitration_graphs/build
cd arbitration_graphs/build
cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=true ..
cmake --build . -j9
```

Run all unit tests (C++ and Python) with CTest:

```bash
cmake --build . --target test
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Serving the WebApp GUI</summary>

The GUI consists of
- a web server with static WebApp files, see [`gui/app`](./gui/app)
- a websocket server providing the arbitration graph state to the WebApp

In order to serve the WebApp files, their location must be known to the executable running the web server.
By default (and without further setup), we support these locations:
- the install path, i.e. `/opt/share/arbitration_graphs`
- the current source path for local builds, i.e. `/home/blinky/arbitration_graphs/gui/app/arbitration_graphs` (only works, if no installation has been found)

If you intend to override these, please use the `APP_DIRECTORY` environment variable to define the WebApp path:

```
APP_DIRECTORY=/my/custom/app/path my_awesome_executable
```

### Behavior Verification and Fallback Layers
A safety concept that extends Arbitration Graphs with behavior verification and fallback layers in the context of automated driving has been proposed by Piotr Spieker (n√©e Orzechowski) in his PhD thesis.
This served as the basis for the paper with Nick above.
