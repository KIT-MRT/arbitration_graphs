# Arbitration Graphs Tutorial

Let's write an agent for the famous PacMan game using Arbitration Graphs üïπÔ∏è

## Introduction
- [ ] What to find where in the repo?
- [ ] What is the goal of the tutorial?

## Tasks

1. [Implement your first behavior component](./tasks/1_implement_behavior_component.md)
2. [Extend the arbitration graph with that behavior](./tasks/2_extend_arbitration_graph.md)
3. [Add even more behavior components](./tasks/3_add_more_behaviors.md)
4. [Learn about nested arbitration graphs](./tasks/4_nested_arbitrators.md)
5. [Arbitrate based on predicted utility](./tasks/5_cost_arbitration.md)


- [ ] Finish chase ghost finish so that is passes unit tests by re-implementing some removed part, e.g. getCommand
- [ ] Integrate chase ghost into priority arbitrator
- [ ] Integrate eat closest dot behavior
- [ ] Integrate eat dot arbitrator as random arbitrator
- [ ] Replace arbitrator from previous step with cost arbitrator, finish cost estimator

## General TODOs
- [ ] Add a bit of an explanation about arbitration graphs to top-level readme
