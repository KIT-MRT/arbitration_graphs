# This is a config file for Jekyll, the static site generator used by GitHub Pages.
#
# In our setup, the top-level README.md is the landing page,
# while the rest of the pages and all assets are in the docs folder.
#
# This way, we can use the main branchs' README.md as main website,
# add subpages for the tutorial and deep dive docs,
# while avoiding Jekyll clutter in the repo root.

# Tell Jekyll to use README.md and docs/ only.
#
# For some reason exluding root and then including only these does not work,
# see https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/9116
# So, we have to take the explicit detourâ€¦
